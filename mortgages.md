# Fixed Rate Mortgages

A mortgage in which the interest rate remains the same throughout the entire life of the loan is a fixed rate mortgage. These loans are the most popular ones, representing over 75% of all home loans. They usually come in terms of 30, 15, or 10 years, with the 30-year option being the most popular. While the 30-year option is the most popular, a 15-year builds equity much faster.

The biggest advantage of having a fixed rate is that the homeowner knows exactly when the interest and principal payments will be for the length of the loan. This allows the homeowner to budget easier because they know that the interest rate will never change for the duration of the loan.

Not only are fixed rate mortgages the most popular of home loans, but they are also the most predictable. The rate that is agreed upon in the beginning is the rate that will be charged for the entire life of the note. The homeowner can budget because the monthly payments remain the same throughout the entire length of the loan. 

When rates are high and the homeowner acquires a fixed rate mortgage, the homeowner is later able to refinance when the rates go down. If the interest rates go down and the homeowner wants to refinance, the closing costs must be paid in order to do so. Some banks wishing to keep a good customer account may wave closing costs.

 If a buyer buys when rates are low they keep that rate locked in even if the broader interest rate environment rises. However, homebuyers pay a premium for locking in certainty, as the interest rates of fixed rate loans are usually higher than on adjustable rate home loans.

## 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage

The traditional loan is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. This is the most popular loan for those buying homes for the first time and even those who own more than one home. The 30-year fixed home loan fits more financial situations than any other home loan. This loan program also allows the homebuyer to have low monthly payments without paying large amounts of interest over the life of the loan. The rate is also fixed and will never change during the life of the mortgage. That makes this loan the perfect choice for future homeowners.

Highlights of the 30 year fixed rate mortgage are:

* If the homebuyer chooses to increase their monthly payments, they can increase the equity that is in their home.
* There are usually no pre-payment penalties with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.
* The low payments allow the homebuyer to use their extra money for investing and on other expenses.

## 15 Year Fixed Rate Mortage

A 15-year fixed rate mortgage allows the homebuyer to own their home free and clear in a 15- year period. While the monthly payments are a little higher than a 30-year mortgage, the interest rate on the 15-year mortgage is a little lower most of the time. 

The homebuyer also pays less than half of the total interest of the traditional 30-year mortgage. A 15 year fixed rate mortgage allows younger homebuyers with the income to meet the higher monthly payments to pay off the house before their children enter college. 

This kind of mortgage allows them to own more of their home faster with this mortgage. Homebuyers who are established in their careers tend to have higher incomes and they desire to own their homes before they retire. These are the types of people who may prefer this kind of mortgage.

Some advantages of the 15 year fixed rate mortgage are:

* The homebuyer owns their home in half the time it would take them to own it through a traditional mortgage.
* The homebuyer saves more than half of the amount of interest paid in a 30-year mortgage.
* Lenders usually offer this type of mortgage at a lower interest rate than the interest rate of a 30-year loan.

# Reverse Mortgages

For homeowners, 62 and above, a reverse mortgage enables them to convert a portion of the equity in their homes into tax-free income without selling the home, taking a new monthly mortgage payment, or giving up their title. The reverse mortgage is names such because the stream of payments is “reversed.” Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, the lender makes the payment to the homeowner.

There are three basic types of reverse mortgages:

1. Federally-insured reverse mortgages, which are also known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages and are supported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
2. Single-purpose reverse mortgages, which are offered by various local and state government agencies and non-profit organizations.
3. Proprietary reverse mortgages, which come in the form of private loans that are supported by the companies that create them.

# Mortgage Loan Calculator

This is a typical mortgage calculator for fixed-rate mortgage loans. This calculator has graphing capabilities and can also display either monthly or annual amortization schedules based on the loan starting date. You can also add property taxes, PMI costs, HOA fee, insurance, and other related costs to estimate your total monthly out-of-pocket cost.

A mortgage is a loan secured by a property – usually a real estate property. A real estate mortgage includes the following key components:

* Loan Amount—the amount you borrow from your lender or bank. The loan amount you can borrow normally correlates to your household income or affordability. To estimate the amount, you can afford, please use our House Affordability Calculator.

* Down Payment—a percentage of the total amount of the loan, to be paid upfront. In the United States, if the down payment is less than 20% of the total property price, a PMI normally must be purchased until the principal arrives at less than 80% of the total property price. The PMI rate normally ranges from 0.3%-1.5% \(typically 1%\) of the total loan amount, depending on various factors. Additionally, banks normally will not give you a good interest rate if your down payment is less than 20%.

* Loan Terms—the length of time you have to repay the loan. Typical loan terms in the United States vary from 30 years, 20 years, 15 years, 10 years, 5 years, and so forth. Normally, the shorter the loan term, the lower the interest rate.

* Interest Rate—the interest rate of a mortgage can be "fixed" \(otherwise known as a fixed-rate mortgage, or FRM\), or "adjustable" \(otherwise known as an adjustable rate mortgage, or ARM\). For ARMs, the interest rate is generally fixed for a period of time, after which it will periodically "adjust," based on market indices. An ARM transfers part of the risk to the borrower; therefore, the initial interest rate is normally 0.5% to 2% lower than a 30-year fixed rate. Mortgage interest rates are normally expressed in Annual Percentage Rate \(APR\), which was sometimes called nominal APR or effective APR. It is the rate expressed as the periodic interest rate times the number of compounding periods in a year. For example, if your mortgage rate is 6% APR, it means you will pay 6%/12 = 0.5% interest every month. Normally, the transaction cost and fees are taking into account when calculating APR.

* Repayment—the most common way to repay a mortgage loan is to make monthly, fixed payments to the lender. The payment contains both the principal and the interest. For a 30-year loan, the majority of the payments you make in the first few years will cover the interest.

The total cost of owning a home is more than just the monthly payment, or the mortgage. When planning to purchase a home, you should also consider other necessities and extras. The following is a list of the possible costs:

* Property Taxes—A property tax is a tax that property owner pays to governing authority. In the United States, property tax is usually managed by municipal government or county government. The annual real estate tax in the United States varies per location, normally ranging from 0% to 4% of the property value. In some extreme cases, the tax rate can be 10% or higher.

* Home Insurance—Also called homeowner's insurance, is an insurance policy that protect the owner from accidents that may happen to the private residence or other real estate properties. Home insurance policies in the United States also contain personal liability coverage, which protects against lawsuits involving injuries that occur on and off the property. Home insurance is required by most lenders. The cost of home insurance varies per locations, condition of the property, coverage amount, etc. Typically, the annual cost ranges from 0.1% to 5% of the property values.

* **PMI Insurance**—Private Mortgage Insurance \(PMI\) is an insurance policy that protects the mortgage lender if the borrower is unable to repay. In the United States, if the down payment is less than 20% of the property value, the lender normally will require the borrower to purchase PMI until the loan-to-value ratio \(LTV\) reach 80%. PMI price varies per down payment amount, size of the loan, credit of the borrower, etc. The annual cost typically ranges from 0.3% to 1.5% of the loan amount.

* **HOA Fee**—Homeowners Association \(HOA\) Fee is the fee that imposed on the property owner by HOA, which is an organization that helps maintaining and improving property and environment in the same group. Condominium and townhouse normally have HOA. It may also exist in some single family community. HOA fee typically ranges from a few hundreds to a few thousand dollars per year in the United States.

* **Other Costs**—This includes utilities, home maintenance costs, etc. Home utilities and maintenance costs can be expensive. For example, it is common to spend more than $500 per month in heating during the winter months in New York for a 2,000 square foot house. Maintenance costs can be expensive too. It is not uncommon to spend 1% of your total property value for home repairs each year.

* **Closing Cost**—It is fees paid at the closing of a real estate transaction. It is not a recurring fee yet it can be expensive. In the United States it includes attorney fee, title service cost, recording fees, survey fee, property transfer tax, brokerage commission, mortgage application fees, points, appraisal fees, Inspection fees, home warranties, pre-paid home insurance, pro-rata property taxes, pro-rata homeowner association dues, pro-rata Interest, etc. Not all of these are applicable depending on your specific situations. The seller will share some of the cost. However, it is normal to pay $10,000 closing cost on a $300,000 transaction for a buyer.

# Mortgage Payoff Calculator

As the Mortgage Payoff Calculator, and the accompanying Amortization Table show, each payment that you make on your mortgage has two elements: Interest and Principal. Mortgages are set up so that you start out by paying a lot of interest, and only a little principal. It's only when you get to the last years of repayment that you start cutting heavily into the principal.

This is why even small extra amounts added to your monthly payment would make a difference. Even five-six dollars added to the monthly mortgage payment cut into the principal. Sure, it's only a few bucks, but it's a few bucks each month where it matters, because the next interest payments will be reduced, even if only a small amount. That brings you closer to reducing the principal altogether.

How much does it matter? Suppose you have a payment for $644? Why not just round it up to $650? An extra $6 a month on a $200,000, 30-year loan can save you four payments at the end of the mortgage – try it out on the calculator and see!

But always remember: So long as you have financial flexibility, you have control, and not the bank. You can pay off your 30-year mortgage faster, and get the benefits of refinancing without going through the hassles or paying the extra costs. 

Still another way of paying off the mortgage earlier: It's now possible to set up biweekly payments at most banks. If you pay half your regular mortgage payment every other week, you'll have made 26 half-payments, or the equivalent of 13 full monthly payments, at year's end. You may have to do some negotiating with your bank about biweekly payments: Some banks try to charge extra for them, but you can probably negotiate a deal. Many will just accept them for free however, although some will reserve crediting the extra payments until the end of the year.
