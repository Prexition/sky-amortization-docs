# Fixed Rate Mortgages

A mortgage in which the interest rate remains the same throughout the entire life of the loan is a fixed rate mortgage. These loans are the most popular ones, representing over 75% of all home loans. They usually come in terms of 30, 15, or 10 years, with the 30-year option being the most popular. While the 30-year option is the most popular, a 15-year builds equity much faster.

The biggest advantage of having a fixed rate is that the homeowner knows exactly when the interest and principal payments will be for the length of the loan. This allows the homeowner to budget easier because they know that the interest rate will never change for the duration of the loan.

Not only are fixed rate mortgages the most popular of home loans, but they are also the most predictable. The rate that is agreed upon in the beginning is the rate that will be charged for the entire life of the note. The homeowner can budget because the monthly payments remain the same throughout the entire length of the loan. 

When rates are high and the homeowner acquires a fixed rate mortgage, the homeowner is later able to refinance when the rates go down. If the interest rates go down and the homeowner wants to refinance, the closing costs must be paid in order to do so. Some banks wishing to keep a good customer account may wave closing costs.

If a buyer buys when rates are low they keep that rate locked in even if the broader interest rate environment rises. However, homebuyers pay a premium for locking in certainty, as the interest rates of fixed rate loans are usually higher than on adjustable rate home loans.



## 15 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage

A 15-year fixed rate mortgage allows the homebuyer to own their home free and clear in a 15- year period. While the monthly payments are a little higher than a 30-year mortgage, the interest rate on the 15-year mortgage is a little lower most of the time. 

The homebuyer also pays less than half of the total interest of the traditional 30-year mortgage. A 15 year fixed rate mortgage allows younger homebuyers with the income to meet the higher monthly payments to pay off the house before their children enter college. 

This kind of mortgage allows them to own more of their home faster with this mortgage. Homebuyers who are established in their careers tend to have higher incomes and they desire to own their homes before they retire. These are the types of people who may prefer this kind of mortgage.

Some advantages of the 15 year fixed rate mortgage are:

* The homebuyer owns their home in half the time it would take them to own it through a traditional mortgage.
* The homebuyer saves more than half of the amount of interest paid in a 30-year mortgage.
* Lenders usually offer this type of mortgage at a lower interest rate than the interest rate of a 30-year loan.



## 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage

The traditional loan is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. This is the most popular loan for those buying homes for the first time and even those who own more than one home. The 30-year fixed home loan fits more financial situations than any other home loan. This loan program also allows the homebuyer to have low monthly payments without paying large amounts of interest over the life of the loan. The rate is also fixed and will never change during the life of the mortgage. That makes this loan the perfect choice for future homeowners.

Highlights of the 30 year fixed rate mortgage are:

* If the homebuyer chooses to increase their monthly payments, they can increase the equity that is in their home.
* There are usually no pre-payment penalties with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.
* The low payments allow the homebuyer to use their extra money for investing and on other expenses.

# Reverse Mortgages

For homeowners 62 and above, a reverse mortgage enables them to convert a portion of the equity in their homes into tax-free income without selling the home, taking a new monthly mortgage payment, or giving up their title. The reverse mortgage is names such because the stream of payments is “reversed.” Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, the lender makes the payment to the homeowner.

here are three basic types of reverse mortgages:

1. Federally-insured reverse mortgages, which are also known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages and are supported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
2. Single-purpose reverse mortgages, which are offered by various local and state government agencies and non-profit organizations.
3. Proprietary reverse mortgages, which come in the form of private loans that are supported by the companies that create them.
