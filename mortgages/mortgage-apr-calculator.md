# Mortgage APR Calculator

The Mortgage APR Calculator will help you to determine the Annual Percentage Rate \(APR\) that you will be charged on your mortgage. This calculator will also help you to calculate your monthly mortgage payment, as well as the total interest that you will pay on your mortgage and the total amount your payments will add up to over the term of the mortgage.

APR calculation intends to help borrowers make true comparisons between different lending plans. When you obtain a mortgage, the lender will quote the interest rate and the APR, often separately. The APR is defined as an annualized cost of credit. This means that the APR is the rate that you will actually be paying on your mortgage because this figure includes upfront costs such as points, originating fee, and closing cost.
