# Adjustable Rate Mortgage Calculator

This calculator shows a fully amortizing ARM which is the most common type of ARM. The monthly payment is calculated to payoff the entire mortgage balance at the end of the term. The term is typically 30 years. After any fixed interest rate period has passed, the interest rate and payment adjusts at the frequency specified. A Fully Amortizing ARM will also have a maximum rate that it will not exceed. 

* **Interest rate cap - **This is the highest interest rate allowed by your mortgage. Your actual interest rate will not be adjusted above this rate.

* **Months before first adjustment - **This is the number of months that the interest rate is fixed. After this period, the interest rate will be subject to rate adjustments. If you enter zero in this field, we assume that the rate will begin making adjustments after initial period of time between adjustments has passed. If any number other than zero is entered, the first adjustment will take place at that time, and adjustments will happen at the frequency entered in the "months between adjustments" field.

* **Expected adjustment - **The amount you believe that your mortgage's interest rate will change. This amount will be added to or subtracted from your interest rate.

* **Months between adjustments - **The number of payment periods between potential adjustments to your interest rate. The most common is 12 months, which means your payment could change at most once per year.

An adjustable-rate mortgage is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate applied on the outstanding balance varies throughout the life of the loan. Normally, the initial interest rate is fixed for a period of time, after which it resets periodically, often every year or even monthly. The interest rate resets based on a benchmark or index plus an additional spread, called an ARM margin.

Also called a variable-rate or floating rate mortgage, ARMs take a number of different forms;

Typically, ARMs are expressed as two numbers. In most cases, the first number indicates the length of time the fixed-rate is applied to the loan, but there is no set formula defining what the second number indicates. For example, a 2/28 ARM and a 3/27 ARM feature a fixed rate for two or three years, respectively, followed by a floating rate for the remaining 28 or 27 years. In contrast, a 5/1 ARM boasts a fixed rate for five years, followed by a variable rate that adjusts every year \(indicated by the one\). Similarly, a 5/5 ARM starts with a fixed rate for five years and then adjusts every five years. Contrary to that formula, a 5/6 ARM has a fixed rate for five years and then adjusts every six months.
