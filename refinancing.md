# Refinancing

To refinance a loan, you take out a new loan, and pay off the old one with it. Obviously, the new loan should offer you improved terms over the old loan. If the old loan involved the use of collateral \(assets you own that guaranteed the loan\), they can also be used for the new loan. Sometimes a borrower will borrow a little extra during refinancing to take some equity out of an asset \(known as "**cash out" refinancing**\).

The calculator can also help you to work out the contingencies of refinancing. With a 30-year, $100,000 loan at 5 percent, your principal and interest payments are $537. At the same rate, but on a 15-year payoff schedule, your principal and interest payments are $791. That's $254 more a month, but you'll own your home in a much shorter time, and pay less interest. Of course, you could also try to refinance for 30 years at a lower rate of interest, and that will cut down on your payments
