# Debt-to-income Ratio Calculator

The debt-to-income ratio \(DTI\) is expressed as a percentage and is your total "minimum" monthly debt divided by your gross monthly income. The debt-to-income calculator takes in to account your annual income and monthly debts to determine your debt-to-income ratio. The calculator will also display your likely eligibility for receiving a mortgage based on your debt-to-income ratio. This calculator assumes you only have one mortgage and that your current housing expenses will be applied toward your new home.
