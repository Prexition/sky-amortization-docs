# Interest Only Loan

The borrower only pays the interest on the mortgage through monthly payments for a term that is fixed on an interest-only mortgage loan. The term is usually between 5 and 7 years. After the term is over, many refinance their homes, make a lump sum payment, or they begin paying off the principal of the loan. However, when paying the principal, payments significantly increase.

If the borrower decides to use the interest-only option each month during the interest-only period, the payment will not include payments toward the principal. The loan balance will actually remain unchanged unless the borrower pays extra.

The borrower may consider an interest only mortgage if they:

* Desire to afford more home now.
* Know that the home will need to be sold within a short time period.
* Want the initial payment to be lower and they have the confidence that they can deal with a large payment increase in the future.
* Are certain they can get a significantly higher rate of return investing the money elsewhere.

### Advantages of Interest Only Loans

There are pros and cons with each different type of mortgage. The advantages of having an interest only mortgage loan are:

* Monthly payments are low during the term.
* The borrower can purchase a larger home later by qualifying for a larger loan amount.
* Placing extra money into investments to build net worth.
* During the interest-only period, the whole amount of the monthly payment qualifies as tax-deductible.

### Disadvantages of Interest Only Loans

There are some drawbacks to interest-only mortgage plans. These disadvantages are:

* Rising mortgage rates increases risk if itâ€™s an ARM.
* Many people spend extra money instead of investing it.
* Many cannot afford principal payments when the time arrives and many are not disciplined enough to pay extra toward the principal.
* Income may not grow as quickly as planned.
* The home may not appreciate as fast as the borrower would like.

As the name suggest this is an interest only loan, meaning only the interest is paid on this loan for the duration. The principal financed amount will therefore stay the same at the end of the term.
