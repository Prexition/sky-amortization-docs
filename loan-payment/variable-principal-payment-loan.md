# Variable Principal Payment Loan

The extra payments on this type of loan can only be seen on the schedule tables, where the extra payments can be added. The savings associated with this type of loan can only be realized if the extra payment is consistent even if it is varied. Paying extra on your mortgage no matter how small it is, will always have a great impact on your loan amount.
