# Extra Principal Payment Loan

Paying extra on your mortgage can be helpful if you can afford it. The extra amount is paid in addition to the regular mortgage every month. This method will reduce the number of payments and save you a lot of money on your interest payments.

Any amount paid on your mortgage consistently over time will have a great impact on your loan.
