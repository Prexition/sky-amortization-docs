# Balloon Schedule

Balloon mortgages can be useful if used judiciously. Regular payments are made on the loan but, a pre-determined amount is scheduled to be paid at the end of the term in a lump sum. This loan type allows for a reduced monthly payment for a specific time period only to pay a huge sum at the end.
