# Discounted Loan

To calculate the bank discount, use the formula D = S x d x t multiply the note maturity value \(s\), with the annual bank discount rate \(d\) and the time in years \(t\), the results is displayed in dollars. 

This practice is a short-term lending arrangement in which interest amount for the entire loan period \(plus other charges, if any\) is deducted from the principal at the time a loan is disbursed. The borrower pays off the loan \(the full principal amount\) as arranged.
