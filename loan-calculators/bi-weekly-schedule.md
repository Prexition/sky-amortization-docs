# Bi-Weekly Schedule

This type of loan allows payments to be made on a bi-weekly basis instead of the traditional once a month payments. The terms being the same the number payments increase to twenty-six payments in the year. The bi-weekly is a money saver and also cuts down on the number of years on the loan term.
