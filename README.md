# Introduction

SkyByte Calculators have been built from scratch and chosen carefully to carry the very essence of the current climate in the Mortgage Industry. The need to “know before you owe” championed by the Federal government is the center piece of financing or refinancing real estate in this environment. The consumer has been empowered to understand the “numbers” before signing any document. Making these calculators available will definitely help to simplify a complex process and bring a needed relief to a confused consumer. It is our hope that these calculators will aide in the determination of the accurate figures in any real estate transactions.

Each calculator was coded individually and put through a strict, comprehensive testing. However, please inform us if you notice any error in our calculations. Your input is very important to us.

In an attempt to aid you in personalizing output, provisions have been made to accommodate your company logo and preparer’s information. There is also a comments space provided for any special instructions that may be noted.
