# What is Amortization?

Webster's dictionary defines amortization as, "the systematic repayment of a debt". The emphasis is on the word "systematic". Amortizing a loan means paying it down, bit by bit. Usually this means making regular monthly payments, and this is what is done for mortgage, for example. But any periodic payment over time to a loan is amortization.

The great advantage of amortization is that you know how much you have to pay each month, under a fixed interest rate, to finish paying off the loan at a specific time. You can work out an amortization table to show each payment. When you take out a mortgage, you make a monthly payment to the lender, and that is an amortization payment. A part of the payment covers the interest due on the loan, and the remainder of the payment goes to reduce the principal amount owed. Interest is computed on the amount owed and thus will become progressively smaller as the principal is decreased.

In the beginning, you will be making large interest payments and small payments to the principal. As time goes on, you will reduce the principal to the point that you haven't got much to pay in interest, and so your payment covers mostly the principal.



# How the Amortization Software Works

The software is designed in a way that it works very simple and intuitive. The interface is designed to move to the right for a new window, making it very adaptable to tablets and smart phones.

In the example below there is a Loan request for $500,000 with a Down Payment of $10,000 and an additional charge of $2,000 and also a Pre-Paid Interest of $1,000. The Interest Rate on the Loan is 4.25% with a 30year Loan Term. As the Loan information is entered directly into the software the Monthly Payment is displayed in a different shade of color to highlight the payment

Once the entry and the display are completed the next thing to do is to click the icon below the Monthly Payment display to show the Amortization Schedules. The Schedule can be displayed in either Annual or Monthly. The summaries of the Loan are also displayed in the table for a quick glance at the most important information about the Loan.

# Graphs and Charts

Graphs and Charts are a great way of communicating a complex idea in an illustrative way to get a point across.

For the ease of quick understanding and comparison of the Loan information, colorful Graphs have been added to give extra depth into the summary of things. The Visual Graph Display is available to add depth to an amortization table and it can be printed. They are in the form of bar graphs, line graphs, area charts and pie charts.

Colorful graphs that visualize data in a clear and distinguishable manner can be used to impress an audience in a serious business setting. In an in-depth analysis two or multiple graphs can be constructed side by side to compare how changing different values can impact any calculated amortization scenario.
